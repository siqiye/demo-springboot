### **Spring Boot Project - Student Management API**  
**Tech Stack:** Java, Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, IntelliJ IDEA, H2/PostgreSQL, REST API  

- **Developed a RESTful API** for student management using **Spring Boot**, handling CRUD operations for student entities.  
- **Implemented layered architecture** with an API layer, business layer, and data layer, ensuring modularity and maintainability.  
- **Utilized Spring Boot features** such as **dependency injection, properties configuration, and Spring Initializr** for project setup.  
- **Integrated Spring Data JPA** for database interactions, defining the `Student` entity and managing persistence with a `JpaRepository`.  
- **Implemented HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`, `DELETE`)** to retrieve, add, and remove students, using `@RestController` and `@RequestMapping`.  
- **Handled business logic validation** in the service layer, ensuring proper data integrity before persisting student records.  
- **Tested API endpoints** using IntelliJ HTTP Client and Postman, validating `POST` requests and verifying database transactions.  
- **Packaged and deployed the application**, configuring the database connection and running the project in different environments.  

âœ… **Impact:** Built a functional and scalable **Spring Boot API** with a structured database integration, demonstrating proficiency in backend development and RESTful API design. ðŸš€
